equality
- X==Y succeeds if X & Y are identical
- X\==Y succeeds if X & Y are different
- X=Y succeeds if X & Y unify. If both X & Y are uninstantiated variables, they share the same value. As soon as one is instantiated, so is the other.

EXAMPLE:
?- a == a.  
yes
?- a == 'a'.
yes
?- a \== a.  
no
?- X = a, X == a.
X = a ? yes
