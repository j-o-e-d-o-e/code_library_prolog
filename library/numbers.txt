numbers
- f(x,y) applies functor f to x & y (original notation)
- 'x f y' applies infix-operator f to x & y (simplified notation)
- 'is' operates like equal-sign & forces evaluation (like comparisons)
- as for 'is' & comparison operators, variables on right-hand side must be instantiated before execution
- X =:= Y succeeds if X & Y stand for the same number (alternatively, X == Y)
- X =\= Y succeeds if X & Y stand for different numbers (alternatively, X \== Y)
- note that X =< Y, Y >= Y

EXAMPLES:
| ?- 5 is +(2,3).
yes
| ?- X is 3/2.
X = 1.5 ?
| ?- X is 3//2.
X = 1 ?
| ?- 3 > 2.
yes
| ?- 1 == 1.
yes
| ?- 1 \== 1.
no
