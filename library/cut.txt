cut
- declared by exclamation mark !
- prevents futile backtracking
- if clause fails before its cut was reached, ! has no effect
- useful if rules are mutually exclusive (like  if-else-statements)
- cut commits system to all choices made due to prior goals in the same clause
- as for goals after the cut in the same clause, backtracking will still be possible
- if ! is reached, any attempt to match with head of another clause is omitted
- cut is often used in combination with 'fail'. instead not(X) can often be used

EXAMPLE:
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.
max(X, Y, Y).
| ?- max(3, 4, X).
X = 4 ?
