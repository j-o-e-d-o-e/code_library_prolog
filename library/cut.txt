cut
- declared by exclamation mark
- prevents futile backtracking
- useful if rules are mutually exclusive (like  if-else-statements)
- as a pseudo-goal cut succeeds immediately
- cut commits system to all choices made since it has chosen the present rule
- the system will not consider alternative solutions for these goals
- the choice of the rule that the cut appears in is also bypassed on backtracking
- goals after the cut can still be backtracked
- cut is often used in combination with 'fail' (like 'not')

EXAMPLE:
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.
max(X, Y, Y).
| ?- max(3, 4, X).
X = 4 ?

foo:- a, b, c, !, d, e, f.
%backtracking possible as normal until success of c
%then, backtracking can occur among d, e & f
%if d fails, no backtracking & the entire rule fails
