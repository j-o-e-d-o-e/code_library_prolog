data structures
- constructed by functors
- a functor is defined by its name and arity (amount of arguments)
- the lexical scope of structures is one clause

EXAMPLE:
make_date(D,M,Y,date(D,M,Y)).
get_year(date(_,_,Y),Y).
| ?- make_date(3,10,1985,Date), get_year(Date, Year).
Date = date(3,10,1985), Year = 1985 ?
